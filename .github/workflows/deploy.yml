        # CRITICAL FIX 1: If assets are not at the root of the repo (e.g., in a sub-folder like 'src/'), 
        # using submodules can sometimes resolve path issues.

          cache: 'npm' 
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        # FIX 3: Use 'npm install' instead of 'npm ci' if you haven't committed package-lock.json yet. 
        # If package-lock.json is present, 'npm ci' is preferred for speed and strictness.
        run: npm install 

      - name: Build site (Creates the 'dist' folder)
        run: npm run build

      # CRITICAL FIX 4: Add step to create .nojekyll file to prevent GH Pages from ignoring files
      # (e.g., files starting with underscores) and ensures Vite's output is served as a static site.
      - name: Create .nojekyll
        run: touch dist/.nojekyll
